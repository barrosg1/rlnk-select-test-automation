Python IDE: PyCharm
Python Version:  2.7.13
Selenium Web driver version: 3.8.0

Note: IE version 9 and onwards does not accept username and password in the url. For example:

    http://username:password@192.168.0.34 will NOT work

To run the test on different browsers (IE, Chrome, Firefox, Edge) in parallel, Selenium Standalone Server must be
used. For this test suite, Selenium Server is not used. See http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/ for more information.

** Main Files **
- fixtures_test.py: extends unnittest and sets up the browsers to test
- selenium_driver.py: handy class to minimize selenium repetitive tasks
- string_constants.py: functions that return strings (primarily for element locators)
- test_operations.py: general functions
- run.py: this is where the tests need to be executed. To test individual test, comment out the other ones in the tests array
- uut_addresses.txt: this is where the UUT ip addresses (url) are stored to test
- test_ctrl_and_atp.txt: ip addresses to test CTRL and address to ping (this test isn't finished)

- HTML Reports -
To see results in HTML, open HTML_Reports directory after executing the test suite. The executed test will have an html
file with the date and time of the execution.

See selenium_help directory to see most used functions, xpaths, and other useful information.
